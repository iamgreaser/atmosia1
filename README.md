# Atmosia 1

A mod that will eventually add atmospheric pressure and whatnot and will knock you around, but right now I'm using redstone as some sort of magnetic field or something, for the express purpose of testing how players and non-players behave when various forces are applied.

Yes, the 1 is deliberate. What I would defer into an Atmosia 2 would be the ability to have a mixture of different gasses. Until then, you've got "air" and that's it. (No, a vacuum is not a gas).
